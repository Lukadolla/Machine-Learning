# Machine-Learning
Repository containing assignments from Machine Learning and Connectionist Computing modules 

The Machine Learning assignments consisted of cleaning datasets from animal shelters and training several learning models on them. Some of the learning models used include KNN, Naive Bays, Decision Trees and Neural Networks. 

The MLP folder contains a Multi Layered Preceptron that was programmed in Python. This MLP was then trained and tested on an XOR example and SIN using both sigmoidal and hyperbolic tangents with different learning rate and hidden layer counts.
